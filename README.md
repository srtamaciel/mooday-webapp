# Mooday-Welcome to your time
This is the second project at *ironhack* Web Development **bootcamp**, make a Full-stack Web Application from the ground up yourself. Everything has been built in seven days ⏳

## The web 
**Mooday** is a web application in which you can keep track of your daily mood 🗓

Each day you can pick one default mood or create your own (only one mood for day) 😋

Once selected you can modify the name of the mood and click on diary button to write your feelings these day ✏️

Finally, this mood is added to the calendar view so you can keep track of how you have been that month ✨

The goal it's to know the average of your feelings monthly at a glance 👀
